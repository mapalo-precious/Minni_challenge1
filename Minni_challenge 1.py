#Mini Challenge 1
#Write a code that takes in 2 lists x = [-1 -4 -7] and y = [-3 7 4] and calculates the absolute sum

def my_function():
    x=[-1,-4,-7]
    y=[-3,7,4]
    z=sum(x+y)
    return z

print(my_function())

#Mini Challenge 2
#Write a code that takes in two inputs (number of items bought and prices) from the user and calculate the total account balance
def total_():
    items=input("How many items did you buy?")
    items=int()
    prices=input("What are the prices of those items")
    prices=list()
    sum_=sum(prices)
    return sum_

print(total_())

#Mini challenge 3
#Repeat mini challenge 2 (Write a code that takes in two inputs from the user and calculates the total) using lambda expressions instead
